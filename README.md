**Course:** Programming for Data Science with Python - Udacity  

## Project Title
BikeShare Data Analysis

## Description
This project is part of the "Programming for Data Science with Python" Nanodegree by Udacity.  
It allows users to interactively explore US bikeshare data for three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The program enables:
- Filtering data by city, month, and day
- Viewing statistics on travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics
- Displaying raw data in chunks for deeper analysis

## Files used
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python file containing all the logic for data loading, filtering, and analysis
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`: Datasets used for the analysis (provided by Udacity)

## Credits
Developed as part of Udacityâ€™s Data Science Nanodegree.  
Thanks to Udacity for providing the datasets and project structure.
